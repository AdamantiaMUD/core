= AdamantiaMUD Core

This repository contains the core libraries for the Adamantia MUD engine.

== Prior Work

(or "On the shoulders of giants")

Adamantia began its life as a TypeScript fork of the https://github.com/RanvierMUD/ranviermud/[RanvierMUD] engine for Node.js. It has been stripped to the core and rebuilt with inspiration from other MUD engines like CircleMUD as well as games like Dungeons & Dragons.
